#Introduction

Movie Buffs galore!! 
For all of your streaming needs there is a service that is just right for you! As a fellow enthusiast of sitting around and enjoying a film or show a time or two. I decided to bring that everyone that enjoys that as much as I do.
A lot of times I sift through many different platforms and try to find a movie that I will enjoy. There are many times where I scroll and scroll and for some reason I just cannot find something enjoyable to watch. I thought what if instead of going through all the different platforms of streaming services that there are to offer you could find a way to look through all of the different platforms and find what you wanted simultaneously. Somehow it seemed to be a way to decrease the time and it would make things a whole lot easier to find something that you wanted to watch.

#Setup

This project first has a homepage an about page, as well as a list of movies. i decided to include a way to search through all of the film titles to be able to find the one that you wanted. On the HomePage I wanted to show all the different streaming services that were included and the movies that were available on those different platforms. The About Page is pretty simple. It is only explaining what it is all about and where it started. Next comes the fun part!! I was able to include a way to add movies to to the page as well their own information: what platform they are on and additional information about each individual film; when you click on each image it shows that information.

#Credits

I have done this entirely on my own, but I did take some information from earlier projects and lessons that were being taught. This did take a great time to understand and get through the information.
